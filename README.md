# Compurator

## Project summary

### A comparison tool that allows you the convenience of adding products you like on the go with a browser extension and the clarity of comparing and contrasting them side-by-side in your online dashboard, making indecisive online shopping a more enjoyable experience.

### Additional information

For those who cannot decide which new computer they'd like to spend their lives' savings on, those who are clueless in picking out techs for themselves, and those who are plainly just indecisive, this is now the tool to aid you in making your carefully-weighed monetary decision in purchasing a computer (or something else). Endorsed by Richert, Compurator includes both a web extension and a web app. You can add products into your workspaces through our extension as you browse through Amazon. You can then navigate to our web app and have the products you added listed side-by-side for comparison in your workspace. In addition, if you log in with your Google accound, all your workspaces and products will be stored for your next visit.
